# MITRE ATT&CK Lifecycle Guide

A beginner-friendly walkthrough of the full MITRE ATT&CK¬Æ tactics ‚Äî step by step ‚Äî explaining how attackers think and move during a cyberattack. Great for SOC analysts, cybersecurity students, or anyone learning blue team/red team concepts.

## üìö What is MITRE ATT&CK?

> MITRE ATT&CK is a globally accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations.

It maps the steps an attacker follows **from initial reconnaissance to the final impact**.

##  Attack Lifecycle Stages (Tactics)

Here‚Äôs a simplified view of each tactic in the order it typically happens in an attack:

| Step | Tactic | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| 1Ô∏è‚É£ | **Reconnaissance** | Gather information about the target |
| 2Ô∏è‚É£ | **Resource Development** | Build/buy tools for the attack |
| 3Ô∏è‚É£ | **Initial Access** | Break into the system |
| 4Ô∏è‚É£ | **Execution** | Run malicious code |
| 5Ô∏è‚É£ | **Persistence** | Maintain access even after reboots |
| 6Ô∏è‚É£ | **Privilege Escalation** | Gain higher-level permissions |
| 7Ô∏è‚É£ | **Defense Evasion** | Avoid detection by security tools |
| 8Ô∏è‚É£ | **Credential Access** | Steal usernames, passwords, tokens |
| 9Ô∏è‚É£ | **Discovery** | Explore the network and environment |
| üîü | **Lateral Movement** | Move to other systems in the network |
| 11Ô∏è‚É£ | **Collection** | Gather the target data |
| 12Ô∏è‚É£ | **Command and Control** | Remote communication with compromised systems |
| 13Ô∏è‚É£ | **Exfiltration** | Steal and send data out of the network |
| 14Ô∏è‚É£ | **Impact** | Cause damage (e.g., ransomware, data wipe) |
